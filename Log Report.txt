To whom it may concern, 

I am deeply sorry for not contacting you earlier. I seem to have gained access to the early development stage of the so called "Strife Delviery Service" web application. Great job so far. 

I'd never have though Avalanche would take such a wild turn with their doings. Yet I must appriciate the less-destructive path a delivery servcie shall take, in contrast to your prior behavior.

I am confident to believe the misson has been assigned to the most successful developers Shinra has to offer, and I would personally like to make sure it's proggress is not flawed.

I wish you the best of luck, and may the outcome be victorious!

Kind regards, 
The General
